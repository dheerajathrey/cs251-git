\section{Story}
Golmaal is a 2006 Bollywood comedy drama film directed by Rohit Shetty and written by Neeraj Vora.
The film stars Ajay Devgn, Arshad Warsi, Sharman Joshi, Tusshar Kapoor and Rimi Sen in lead roles. 
The opening credits of the movie revealed that the story was based on the Gujarati play Aflatoon by Mihir Bhuta and Neeraj Vora adapted from Harsh Shivsharan's original Marathi play Ghar-Ghar[1][2] which was earlier used in the 2001 Malayalam comedy Kakkakuyil. The film released on 14 July 2006, and received generally positive reviews from the critics, and turned out to be a surprise hit at the box office.
